# user doc structure
- info
  - id: string
  - name
    - name: string - (user's username)
    - search keys: {[key]: true}
    - timestamp updated: Timestamp - (for algorithm versioning & update limiting)
  - tags: string[] - (for filtering searches)
  - tag history: {[tag]: int} - (stores which tags user has used & how many times. Most used ones only are indexed)
  - description: string - (optional)
  - timestamp created: Timestamp
  - timestamp updated: Timestamp
  - device tokens: string[] - (array of device tokens, for sending notifications)
  - storage
    - image file bucket: string - (cloud storage bucket)
    - image file path: string - (cloud storage path)
- deleted
  - timestamp deleted: timestamp - (timestamp user deleted their profile)
  - deletion complete: bool - (for querying deleted user profiles for cleanup)
  - following deleted: bool - (whether finished unfollowing all followers)
  - saved sounds deleted: bool - (whether finished unsaving saved sounds)
  - saved lists deleted: bool - (whether finished unsaving saved lists)
- properties
  - explicit: bool
  - hidden: bool
  - search keys: string - (for checking whether user profile is explicit or hidden. There are 4 possible keys: "hidden & explicit", "hidden & not_explicit", "not_hidden & explicit", "not_hidden & not_explicit")
  - random seeds: {[int]: double} - (for random searches, key is random seed num, there will be 4 random seeds. Will have following structure: {1: [random num], 2: [random num], 3: [random num], 4: [random num]})
- metrics (all follow same structure)
  - soonest stale: Timestamp - (smallest stale timestamp, for rejuvinating stale metrics)
  - followers
    - total: int - (all time)
    - timestamp updated: Timestamp
    - this week: int
    - this month: int
    - this year: int
    - this decade: int
    - this century: int
    - this millenium: int
    - week stale: Timestamp - (timestamp downloads are stale, after this timestamp downloads will be set to 0. If metrics updated after this, means stale function hasn't caught it yet. In this case need to set to 0, and update stale timestamp to next time period end)
    - month stale: Timestamp
    - year stale: Timestamp
    - decade stale: Timestamp
    - century stale: Timestamp
    - millenium stale: Timestamp
  - following
    - ...
  - sounds created
    - ...
  - lists created
    - ...
  - best (combination of all metrics)
    - ...
- legal (legal information, if has received copyright notices before & not removed chances are it's not infringing) 
  - received copyright notices: int
  - received trademark notices: int
  - times audio file reported: int
  - times image file reported: int
  - times text reported: int
  - cant upload audio files until: Timestamp - (these depend on how many times content type reported)
  - cant upload image files until: Timestamp
  - cant upload text until: Timestamp

# user doc general stuff
- any time user doc is updated, random seeds are too, for randomization purposes
- username can only be updated once every 6 months (if timestamp_now - timestamp_name_updated > 6 months)
- pretty much all fields are same as sound doc, only differences are 
  - image files instead of sound files
  - legal fields & limitations
  - tags only contain tags user has used the most. This is stored in tag history. This is to prevent too many composite tag combos since there will be lots of them

## updating duplicate docs in followers sub-collection
- when user updates their username, it updates it at the following locations
  - here (the main user doc)
  - in their follower sub-collection doc duplicates (for sorting queries)
  - rtdb uid-username key-value pair
- other than that, no other reason to update them

## legal
legal process
- when user receives legal notice, they have 7 days to respond. If they respond during this time period, they won't receive punishment. To respond user can:
  - send counter notice
  - if username infringing, change username
  - if image infringing, change image
- if user doesn't respond during 7 day time period, image will be removed or username will be randomized, "received [copyright or trademark] notices" & "times [image file, audio file, or text] reported" will increment, & "cant upload [image file, audio file, or text] until" will be incremented accordingly. If user has received more than 3 violations:
  - if can't upload until is in future, then add (2 days) to timestamp
  - if can't upload until isn't set or already passed, set to (current timestamp) + (# of violations) * (2 days)
- in this case user can't respond after 7 day period since changes will be un-revertable
- if user sends counter notice, notice will be considered resolved, & notice sender will be notified. Message sent to notice sender will say something like "User has sent a counter notice, we have to revert changes. Any further requests will have to be pursued legally. Upon reception of a court order to remove said content we can't really do anything else"

## user deletion
- when user deletes account:
  - deleted.timestamp_deleted is set & deleted.deletion_complete is set to false
  - their user doc is marked as hidden & not explicit
  - their profile image is deleted
  <!-- - their username in rtdb is set to "0" (string of char "0"). In app will show "deleted" in red  --> why set id to 0? In case user signs in again won't work, allows usernames to be recycled though if not in use
  - their sounds & lists will not be deleted, they'll still exist
  - their saved sounds & lists docs will be deleted, they'll be removed from all sound sub-docs that contain them (since only 100 get-all should be quick & easy), & all saved lists & sound save counts will be decremented
  - following docs are deleted, following count is set to 0, all users now deleted user was following have follower count push false in rtdb (to decrease follower count)
  - follower sub-collection with duplicate docs are kept for showing user in other user's following lists
- if user goes to deleted user's account, it won't show profile image or username (username will show "deleted" in red), but it will still show deleted user's ringtones. Might show last username in light grey after it, ex: "deleted - chabz", with "deleted" in red and "- chabz" in light grey
- periodic function will query where user deleted.deletion_complete is false, deleted.timestamp_deleted < (now - 1 month), and do necessary cleanup. this can be done later, if need to reduce storage space
- user can sign in when profile marked deleted
  - deleted field in their user doc will be removed so cleanup doesn't continue
  - profile will be marked as not hidden & not explicit
