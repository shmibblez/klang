# rtdb structure
- metrics
  - sounds - (same for all objects, only difference is actual metrics)
    - sound id
      - saves - (same for all metrics)
        - timestamp start - (stores earliest timestamp before sound doc updated) (ok to store with uids since always different lengths, also makes cleanup after update easier since deletes everything)
          - [push id]: Timestamp - (timestamp user updated metric, smallest one is only important one & will be listed first)
        - [push id]: bool - (true if added, false if removed)
      - downloads - (only one that uses uid, to prevent duplicate entries)
        - ...
        - [user id]: bool - (can only be true -> can't un-download something)
      - parent lists

      - other metric
